# Design (Reference)

Design principles for this documentation set:
- Prefer explicit link graphs (`parent`, `implements`, `verifies`, `blocks`, `depends`) over prose.
- Capture workflows as short, command-oriented notes with prerequisites and expected artifacts.
- Treat external “source of truth” inputs (schemas/configs/contracts) as first-class; document their schema and invariants.
- Keep changes traceable with `type: [[change]]` notes linked to issues/features/workflows/decisions.
