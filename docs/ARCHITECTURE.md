# Architecture (Reference)

> REPLACE ME (template): Replace the overview, entrypoints, and key directories to match your project.

This repo contains project code and a documentation system under `docs/` (Obsidian-enabled; Obsidian optional).

## Canonical entrypoints (REPLACE ME)
- Primary developer workflow(s): `REPLACE ME` (paths to scripts/commands)
- CI workflow(s): `REPLACE ME`
- Release/build workflow(s): `REPLACE ME`

## Key directories (REPLACE ME)
- `docs/`: documentation system (notes + frontmatter; dashboards query via Bases)
- `tools/`: instructions and playbooks for maintaining the docs system
- `src/` (optional): compiled tools/libraries (if applicable)
- `REPLACE ME`: project-specific code/data directories
