# Simple Note Without Frontmatter

This markdown file has no frontmatter, so it should use all default values:
- Type: standard
- Realtime: false

## Content Section

This is just regular markdown content that will be converted to a .note file.

### Subsection

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

**Bold text** and *italic text* should work fine.

> This is a blockquote.

```python
# Code blocks should also work
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
