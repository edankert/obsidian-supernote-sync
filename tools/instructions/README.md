# Instructions

This directory contains **normative instructions** for how documentation and automation should be authored and maintained in this repo.

## Rules for instruction documents
- Keep instruction files stable and broadly applicable; prefer updating tasks/issues for one-off work.
- Use a short title and explicit “Rules” bullets; avoid narrative prose where possible.
- If a rule affects existing content, update both the instruction and any templates/dashboards that rely on it.
- Prefer repo-relative paths in code spans (e.g. `../../docs/INDEX.md`, `scripts/build.sh`).
