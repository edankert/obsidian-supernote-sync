# `tools/skills/`

Reusable playbooks for an LLM (or other agents) to keep this documentation system consistent while doing work. These skills assume `SNAPSHOT.yaml` is the canonical agent state and must be kept in sync with notes.

## What goes here
- One subdirectory per skill, each containing a `SKILL.md` describing:
  - when to use the skill
  - inputs/outputs
  - required snapshot/notes updates
  - step-by-step checklist

## What does not go here
- Project documentation content (belongs under `../../docs/`).
- Obsidian templates (belong under `../../docs/__templates__/`).

## Skills index
- Issue intake: `issue-intake/SKILL.md`
- Feature scaffold: `feature-scaffold/SKILL.md`
- Task breakdown: `task-breakdown/SKILL.md`
- Test authoring: `test-authoring/SKILL.md`
- Risk scan: `risk-scan/SKILL.md`
- Change note: `change-note/SKILL.md`
