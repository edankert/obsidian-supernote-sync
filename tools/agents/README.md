# `tools/agents/`

Reserved for agent-facing collateral (e.g., contributor/LLM operational notes, automation adapters, or future agent configuration).

## What goes here
- Agent-specific guidance that is not part of the documentation system structure itself.
- Lightweight helper files used by automation/agents (if introduced).

## What does not go here
- Project documentation content (belongs under `../../docs/`).
- Normative documentation conventions (belong under `../instructions/`).
